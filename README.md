## 🙏 What is the Bhagawad Gita
- The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most prominent Hindu texts, forming a part of the Indian epic known as Mahabharata. 
- Originally written in Sanskrit, the Bhagavad Gita is believed to have been composed between the 5th and 2nd century BCE.
- It is a guidebook to lead an enjoyable and blissful life. In other words, it is a user’s manual to lead a meaningful human life
- Lord Krishna imparted this knowledge to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when the latter was in a distressful condition
- Upon receiving this knowledge returned to his happy and stable position
- All of us undergo difficult situations in life and often become overwhelmed by those situations not knowing where to find a solution
- The Bhagavad-Gita guides us out of such delusions and reestablishes us in our original position of eternity, knowledge and bliss
- If we follow the instructions as given by Lord Krishna, then we can attain the same blissful state as Arjuna did

## 🌸 Relevance of Bhagavad Gita in Modern Life
- Today’s world brings the word unrest to mind. There is fierce competition for every resource and opportunity. Globalization has put us in close proximity to people that we don’t know and cannot implicitly trust. Over population has us crowding together and getting in each other’s way and on each other’s nerves. The need to achieve, succeed, grow and excel has turned us into a restless bunch. And if today is taken care of, then there is tomorrow to worry about.

- Science and Technology are asking and answering questions about the world around us and making it easier to do anything we set our mind to. Today’s world is an easy and accessible world.
