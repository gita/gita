## 🙏 What is the Bhagawad Gita
- The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most prominent Hindu texts, forming a major part of the Indian epic known as Mahabharata. 
- Originally written in Sanskrit, the Bhagavad Gita is believed to have been composed between the 5th and 2nd century BCE.
- It is a guidebook to lead an enjoyable and blissful life. In other words, it is a user’s manual to lead a meaningful human life.
- Lord Krishna imparted this knowledge to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when the latter was in a distressful condition.
- Upon receiving this knowledge Arjuna returned to his happy and stable state of mind.
- All of us undergo difficult situations in life and often become overwhelmed by those situations not knowing where to find a solution.
- The Bhagavad-Gita guides us out of such delusions and reestablishes us in our original state of eternity, knowledge and bliss.
- If we follow the instructions as given by Lord Krishna, then we can attain the same blissful state as Arjuna did.

## 🌸 How relevant is it in modern times
- The Bhagavad-gita is a manual given by the Supreme Lord Krishna which guides us in making the best use of this human life and to deriving real happiness from it.
- In the modern times when people are confused and misdirected, the Gita becomes all the more relevant for the individual as well as for the society as a whole in bringing back the stability and happiness in life.
